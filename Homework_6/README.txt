Collections Homework
Company has employees.

Some people have parking spaces allocated to them. Other's don't.



Write Company Management System that as an input receives a list of employees.

The Company Management System must allow a way to obtain a list of employees who don't have any parking spaces. This list should be ordered based on the employee's seniority in the company.

Employee's seniority is defined by the years spent in the company - Not the role.



Internally the company keeps the employees in role-specific lists.

All managers will be in a managers collection, all junior software engineers will be in the junior software engineers collection.



Feel free to define any types of roles you wish.



Use at least:

- one List

- one Sorting
